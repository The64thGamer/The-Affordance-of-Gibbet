The Affordance of Gibbet
-------
Gibbet is a 2D platformer focused on obtaining a customizable moveset from the enemies you take out, and trying to not get flung off screen yourself!

Project
-----
This is a fun tiny game being worked on in Godot between major projects. Everything is open-source and copyleft, though the full game is planned to release on Steam. Players will be able to either buy the build there, or compile the build themselves off this page for free.
Control layout is very similar to Smash but condensed to work with just D-pad, two buttons, select, and start. Keyboard and controller layouts however have duplicate keys for an easier experience. The "zap" button ('z' or B button) will attack enemies. If an enemy with an ability is zapped a prompt will appear. Either holding a direction or none at all and pressing the Attack button ('x' or A Button) will select that slot for the ability. Pressing that combination again will unleash the attack.

Progress
-----
Only one stage is sort-of done. A few enemies work. Most of the Player is done. Only a single ability is coded so far- Side Attack for the Soda enemy. Options menu has some items and allows for swapping palettes.
